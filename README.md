# 20-Challenge-GitHub-Action
AS A developer looking to integrate a pipeline in a codebase for continuous integration and deployment,  I WANT to create a GitHub Action that will follow best practices by running test cases when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch SO THAT I can ensure that all code integrations are clean and pass the proper requirements.
